# Korby_WoF_Assessment
## Description
I attempted to recreate Wheel of Fortune using Python to test my coding abilities learnt through lessons from a stage3talent course. 

This project encompasses several key elements of coding in general, those are:
- Variables
- String Manipulation
- Flow Control
- Collections (list, types, sets, and dictionaries)
- Functions
- File I/O

## Install and Use
Download main.py and the data folder containing the phrases.json file. Once installed and the python file and folder are in the same directory, you can run the python file in command line using 'py main.py'
